# Python Course - Curso em Vídeo 🐍

This repository was created with the purpose of storing the exercises I am solving during my Python learning journey through the free course offered by [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.youtube.com/c/CursoemVídeo), taught by professor Gustavo Guanabara.

Here you will find the solutions to the exercises proposed in each module of the course, organized in folders according to the modules/classes.
